        <h2>what is HTML</h2>
        <p>
            HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
             HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap,
              different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. 
              The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, 
              can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.<hr>
        </p>
        <h2>structuring the web with HTML</h2>
        <p>To build websites, you should know about HTML — the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a webpage. 
            HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image,
             multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.
             Before starting this topic, you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively
              (i.e., just looking at it, consuming the content).
              You should have a basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic software, 
              and understand how to create and manage files, 
             as detailed in Dealing with files — both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.
             It is recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before attempting this topic. However, 
             this isn't absolutely necessary; much of what is covered in the HTML basics article is also covered in our Introduction to HTML module,
              albeit in a lot more detail.
             
             After learning HTML, you can then move on to learning about more advanced topics such as:
             
             CSS, and how to use it to style HTML (for example, alter your text size and fonts used, add borders and drop shadows,
             layout your page with multiple columns, add animations and other visual effects).
             JavaScript, and how to use it to add dynamic functionality to web pages (for example, find your location and plot it on a map, 
             make UI elements appear/disappear when you toggle a button, save users' data locally on their computers, and much more).
             Modules
             This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for working through them. You should definitely start with the first one.
             Introduction to HTML
             This module sets the stage, getting you used to important concepts and syntax, looking at applying HTML to text, how to create hyperlinks,
              and how to use HTML to structure a webpage.
             
             <a href="https://www.Multimedia and embedding - Learn web development | MDN.com/" target="-blank"> Multimedia and embedding</a>
             This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images can be included, 
             and how to embed video, audio, and even entire other webpages.

        <h3>HTML attributes</h3>
        <p>All HTML elements can have<i><b>attributes</b></i> <br />
            Attributes provide <b>additional information</b> about elements<br />
            Attributes are always specified in <b>the start tag</b> <br /> 
            Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like:<b> name="value"</b> <br /><br />
            <b>*</b> All HTML elements can have attributes </b><br />
            <b>*</b> The<p style ="color:red";">href </p>  attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to<br />
                <b>*</b> The<p style ="color:red";"> src</p> attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed<br />
                <b>*</b> The<p style ="color:red";"> width</p>and <p style ="color:red";"> height</p> attributes of <img> provide size information for images<br />
                <b>*</b>The<p style ="color:red";"> alt </p> attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image<br />
                <b>*</b>The<p style ="color:red";"> style</p> attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.<br />
                <b>*</b>The<p style ="color:red";"> lang</p>  attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page.<br />
                <b>*</b>The<p style ="color:red";"> title</p> attribute defines some extra information about an element.<br />
        </p> <hr>
        <h3>The paragraph elements</h3>
        <p>  The <a href="https://www.HTML.com/" target="-blank"> HTML</a> element represents a paragraph.
             Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines 
             and/or first-line indentation,
             but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form field
              Paragraphs are block-level elements,
             and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing  
             tag.See "Tag omission" below.</p>.<br />
             <p>Breaking up content into paragraphs helps make a page more accessible.
                 Screen-readers and other assistive technology provide shortcuts to let their users skip to the next or previous paragraph,
                  letting them skim content like how white space lets visual users skip around.

                Using empty elements to add space between paragraphs is problematic for people who navigate with screen-reading technology.
                 Screen readers may announce the paragraph's presence, but not any content contained within it — because there is none. 
                 This can confuse and frustrate the person using the screen reader.
                If extra space is desired, use<a href="https://www.CSS.com/" target="-blank"> CSS </a> 
                 properties like margin to create the effect:</p>
                <p>A paragraph in HTML is simply a block of text enclosed within the <Pp> tag.
                Thetag helps divide content into manageable, readable sections. 
                It’s the go-to element for wrapping text in a web page that is meant to be displayed as a distinct paragraph.
                </p>
                <p>To separate paragraphs,
                     most browsers apply some whitespace by default,
                      helping the reader easily distinguish one paragraph from another.
                      However, there are other ways of separating paragraphs with CSS.<br />

                <h4><b>what we can do with html</b></h4>
                <p>There’s a good chance you’ve heard the term HTML before — 
                    maybe you’ve even dabbled with the markup language as a means to edit your MySpace profile back in the day. 
                    <a href ="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=ccblog&utm_content=html_uses.com/" target="-blank"> HTML and CSS</a> 
                    (Cascading Style Sheets) came on the scene in the late ’90s and are considered the backbone or “power couple” of the internet, because they enable developers to build and structure web content.
                 HTML and CSS are typically the first languages that they start with.
                 HTML has a simple, text-based structure that’s easy for beginners to learn and understand.
                  But what does HTML actually mean? HTML is an acronym that stands for HyperText Markup Language.
                   Markup languages are different from programming languages.
                    Whereas programming languages help us modify data, we use markup languages to determine how elements are displayed on a webpage.

                </p><hr>
                <h5><b>How does it work</b></h5>
                <p>HTML is usually stored in files that use the .htm or .html extension.
                     A website can include hundreds or even thousands of these HTML files kept in various directories.
                    When you visit a web page, its server sends its HTML files to your browser.
                    Your browser then reads the HTML in the files and displays it. 
                    Some web applications don’t use static HTML but generate it in response to specific actions on their servers.
                     In the free beginner course <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-html/#:~:text=Learn%20HTML%3A%20Fundamentals%2C"> Learn HTML: Fundamentals, </a>
                     Fundamentals, you’ll learn how HTML is used to create the structure and content of a web page and get to know the most important HTML elements.
                    We can also add other types of content,
                     like <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-html/#:~:text=of%20content%2C%20like-,CSS,-and%20JavaScript%20files">CSS</a> 
                     and <a href ="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-html/#:~:text=like%20CSS%20and-,JavaScript,-files%2C%20images%2C%20and">JavaScript</a> files, images, and videos, 
                     to add more features to a web page. CSS allows us to add stylistic elements (like colors) to a webpage. JavaScript enables interactivity. 
                     Together, these three languages form the foundation of<a href=" web development" >web development</a>.
