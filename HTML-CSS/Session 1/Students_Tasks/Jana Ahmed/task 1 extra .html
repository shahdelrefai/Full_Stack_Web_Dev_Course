<h1> <b><a style ="color:royalblue;"> How does the internet works ?</a> </b>
</h1>
    <p>The Internet is a network connecting over 4.5 billion users and 1.8 billion websites to one another using standard protocols such as TCP/IP. Information is broken up into discrete units, known as packets,
         which pass through routers and switches and take usually between 20 and 200 milliseconds for a round trip. Every device on the internet is allocated an identifiable address called an Internet Protocol (IP) address,
          for which Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) accommodates slightly above 4.3 billion addresses.
          Since this was being strained, 
        there came IPv6 which had an address space that could offer addresses to all the devices that would possibly get connected in the years to come.

    <h2>How can we retrieve a website ?</h2>
    <P>
        To retrieve an old website,
         first check if you have a backup stored by your backup solution or web host.
          If no backup is available, use the Wayback Machine or search engine cache to recover content</P><hr />
    <h3>Breif Background of Internet</h3>
    <P>With a drastic change over the period, technology has changed.
         Today the Internet has become a necessity and it is being used by more than 2 Billion population throughout the globe. So, if we go back to 1969,
          the journey of the internet started as a host-to-host network interaction and there’s no denying that it couldn’t have been created by any individual.

        Therefore, a team of researchers developed this idea and with the help of programmers and architecture,
         the Internet was born by ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 1969 and was initially called ARPANET.
          Now before we jump in, let’s discuss step by step right from the beginning.
        
        If you break it down, 
        the word Internet is derived from Interconnected Networks and this simply indicates that it needs networks to be interconnected.</P><hr />
        <h4> What is DNS ?</h4>
        <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet.
             Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com.
              Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
               DNS translates <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/">domain names</a> to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/">internat protocol (IP)</a> so browsers can load Internet resources.

            Each device connected to the Internet has a unique<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/">IP address</a>  which other machines use to find the device.
             DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4),
             or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).

        <h5>What is an HTTP/S request ?</h5>
        <p>Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer.
             This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account,
             email service, or health insurance provider.

            Any website, especially those that require login credentials, should use HTTPS.
             In modern web browsers such as Chrome, websites that do not use HTTPS are marked differently than those that are.
              Look for a padlock in the URL bar to signify the webpage is secure.
               Web browsers take HTTPS seriously;<a href ="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-use-https/">Google Chrome and other browsers flag all non-HTTPS websites as not secure. </a> </p><hr />
