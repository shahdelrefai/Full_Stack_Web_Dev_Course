   <h1>What is programming ? </h1>
   <p>Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks
     to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming
   as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions
    for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand
     Programming enables so many things in our lives</p>

     <h2>What’s the difference between coding and programming?</h2>
    <p>
    Coding and programming are sometimes used interchangeablybut the two concepts 
    are slightly different. Coding refers to the act of writing code, while 
    programming refers to creating a set of instructions for a computer to follow,
     or a computer program. Programming can include a broader range of tasks, such as 
     working with data structures and algorithms, that aren’t inherently coding.
